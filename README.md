IMAP Server Tester
==================

ImapTest is a generic IMAP server compliancy tester that works with all IMAP servers. It supports:

 - Stress testing with state tracking. ImapTest sends random commands to the server and verifies that server's output looks correct.
 - Scripted testing where it runs a list of predefined scripted tests and verifies that server returns expected output.
 - Benchmarking
